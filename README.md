## 🚀 Results Summary

| Metric | Description | Result |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Clean Accuracy** | Accuracy on unpoisoned test set | 0.9901 |
| **Attack Success Rate (ASR)** | % of triggered images classified as target | 1.0000 |
| **Neural Cleanse Detection** | Detected anomalous class via MAD analysis | **Class 2 flagged (true target was 0)** |
| **Interpretation** | Neural Cleanse correctly identified the model as backdoored, though with slight target mismatch due to small trigger and fixed λ. |

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Backdoor attacks like **BadNets** can stealthily compromise a model’s predictions with minimal visual changes.
- **Neural Cleanse** is effective in detecting anomalous backdoor patterns using statistical outlier analysis.
- Small triggers and fixed hyperparameters may lead to near-target anomalies rather than exact label detection.
